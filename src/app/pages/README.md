This folder contains the main page components for the Kyoto Gift and Food Website's frontend. Each component here represents a distinct page or view in the application. These components are routed and displayed based on user navigation.

**Folder Structure**

**CategoriesPage.js**
Displays a list of product categories available in the store. Each category is represented by a circular icon that links to the specific category's products. This page serves as an entry point for users to explore different product categories.

**ProductDetail.js**
Shows detailed information about a selected product, including its name, description, price, and nutritional information. This page allows users to view product specifics and add items to their cart.

**Usage**
Component-Based Structure
Each file in the pages folder represents a full page or view in the app. These components are designed to be used with React Router for seamless navigation between pages without reloading the entire application.

**Folder Organization**
The pages folder helps maintain a clear separation between different sections of the application, following the best practices of a component-based architecture in React.
